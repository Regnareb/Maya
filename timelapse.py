'''
- Create the different cameras if they do not exist (1 front, 2 opposite three-quarter profile, 2 moving cameras each (upside-down/middle/bottom-up))
- every X seconds render with the hardware rendered with each cameras
- rotate around the object with some cameras
- zoom-out from the object when it grows (with a smooth transition)
- save the scene every X seconds to do batch renders later. See if the saving is fast enough and does not interrupt the user's work.
